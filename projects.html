        <p>The personal portfolio website is a personal project done in HTML and CSS
          which utilized different types of displays in CSS to style the HTML indifferent
          ways. Flex display was used to create columns and block display was used for images.
          The website functions as a simple portfolio that displays my past projects and provides
          access to the source code when possible.

        <h4>Description of project:</h4>
        <p>The game uses HTML canvas components to display the current status of the game. The project innitually used Firebase as a realtime database to store levels but due to some updates
          the app was no longer able to establish a connection to the database for a Git resposotary so currently to game levels are stored in the JavaScript file that controls the logic behind the game.
          The JavaScript file updates the canvas periodically showing the current position of the player and the level. Moreover the JavaScript file handles the collisions between the player and objects in the level.

        <p> This application uses a GUI created with Java swing which allows the user to apply filters to images.
          The filters include turning the image into grayscale and making the image brighter. Another filter is dithered image where
          the grayscale image is made using dithering. Finally an auto level algorithm was used to implement an filter that
          makes some images look better.

        <p> This application uses a GUI created with Java swing which allows the user to open a wav file and display it as a graph.
          The open file GUI filters out all files thats are not wav file or directories to make chosing the file easy.
          The application reads the file and extracts information like the number of smaples, the sample frequency and the left and right channels.
          The GUI uses a scaling to plot the wav file each of the channels.

        <h4>Description of project:</h4>
        <p> This is a command line app which simulates a library database. The users can use this to find items like CDs or books that are currently in stock
          or find information about the availablity of items. The user can then borrow the item which will mark that item as unavailable. The application also allows the user to
          reserve a event room and register for events. Information like the availablity of items, who has borrowed which item and what rooms have been booked
          are stored in a SQLite database. This database is queried for the app features like checking the users currently borrowed items and returning items to the library.

        <h3>Word Sudoku Android App</h3>

        <h4>Description of project:</h4>
        <p> I developed a Word Sudoku App using Android Studio which helps learn a second language through a sudoku game. The 
          app includes different size grids and 2 modes. The modes signify if the board will have numbers and will pronunce the word when clicked
          or if the board will have french words on it and the user will need to translate them to solve the Sudoku. The development process involved using Git
          for version controll and JUint was used to create unit tests to test the functions of the app. Moreover, manual testing was done to test the user interface.
